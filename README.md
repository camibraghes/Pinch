# Pinch
 Pinch is an application that resizes an image using several gestures, called, gesture such as long-press gesture,
 double-tap gesture, drag gesture, and magnification gesture (a gesture that recognises a magnification motion and tracks the amount of it).
 I applied a blur effect (with color vibrancy) to a view that appears behind another view by adding a material with the background modifier.
 The application is not a view, but adding material is like inserting a translucent layer between the modified view and its background.
